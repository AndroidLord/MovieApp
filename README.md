# Movie App

This is an Android app built using Java and following the MVVM pattern. The app makes use of Retrofit to fetch data from the The Movie DB API and displays the latest and most popular movies with detailed information such as summary, rating, language, and poster. Additionally, the app also allows users to search for specific movies using the search view.
